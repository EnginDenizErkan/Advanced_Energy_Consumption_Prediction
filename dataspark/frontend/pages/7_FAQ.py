        """The electricity consumption predictions are made using the Prophet Time Series Forecasting model with a 30-minute frequency. The model considers a variety of factors and features to enhance prediction accuracy. Here are the key factors and features considered in making consumption predictions:
            \n1. Prophet Model:
               \nThe model of choice for time series forecasting is Prophet. It is designed to handle daily observations that display patterns on different time scales, including holidays and special events.
            \n2. Frequency:
               \nThe time series data is sampled at a 30-minute frequency, capturing fine-grained patterns in electricity consumption.
            \n3. Cross Validation Methods:
               \nTwo different cross-validation methods are employed during training: cross-validation time series and block cross-validation with time series. This helps assess the model's performance under various scenarios.
            \n4. Data Sets:
               \nFour different data sets are utilized:
                 \n-Main data set: Energy consumption of all houses.
                 \n-2nd data set: Energy consumption of families in affluent financial status.
                 \n-3rd data set: Energy consumption of families in comfortable financial status.
                 \n-4th data set: Energy consumption of families in adversity financial status.
            \n5. Generated Features:
               \nNew features are generated to improve the model's predictive capabilities.
                 \n-Date/Time (Date)
                 \n-Energy consumption (Numeric time series)
                 \n-Visibility, windBearing, temperature, dewPoint, pressure, apparentTemperature, windSpeed, precipType, humidity (Numeric time series)
                 \n-Year, month, day, hour, minute (Numeric)
                 \n-Week_day, Season, Holiday (Categorical)
            \n6. Feature Details:
               \nFeatures include both numeric time series and categorical variables, covering various aspects such as weather conditions, date/time components, and socio-economic factors.
               \nDate/Time (Date), energy(kWh/hh) (Numeric time series), visibility (Numeric time series), windBearing (Numeric time series), temperature (Numeric time series), dewPoint (Numeric time series), pressure (Numeric time series), apparentTemperature (Numeric time series), windSpeed (Numeric time series), precipType (Numeric time series), humidity (Numeric time series), year(Numeric), month(Numeric),day(Numeric), hour(Numeric), minute(Numeric), week_day(Categoric), Season(Categoric), Holiday(Categoric)""")
